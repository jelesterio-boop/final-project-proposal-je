<h1>Updated Entry</h1>
<p>This proposal was last updated in Sprint 5 on November 9, 2020.<p>

<h1>Description</h1>
<p>In my application, the user attempts to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21. The game will be set up where the user has to respond to a preset set of questions posed by the dealer. For each card that is revealed to the user, the user has the option of hitting another card or not. In the end, the total sum that will be calculated based on his decisions.
<p>

<h1>Prioritized list of features that can be delivered in time</h1>
<li>The cards that are revealed to the user should be randomized.
<li>The sum of the integers from all card(s) must be calculated correctly.
<li>Different responses should appear if the user scores above 21, exactly at 21, or lower than 21.
      
<h1>Non-prioritized list of features that can be implemented if given more time</h1>
<li>Graphics of the cards being dealt.
<li>Graphics of the dealer expressing different emotions in response to the result of a given game.

<h1>Languages and platforms that will be used</h1>
<li>Python
<li>Visual Studio Code

<h1>Technical features demonstrating what I've learned from class</h1>
<li>Using if, else statements
<li>Using for loops
<li>Using while loops
<li>Using comparison operators

<h1>Technical features that go beyond what we learned from class</h1>
<li>Creating graphics using Python
